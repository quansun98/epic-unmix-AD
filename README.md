Deconvolution of bulk expression profiles with application in Alzheimerâ€™s disease

## code

We provide in-house codes used in our analysis. 

* `01.process.R` provides codes related to some pre-processing of sc/snRNA-seq reference and bulk gene expression data
* `02.cts_decov.R` provides example codes to perform deconvolution

Note that we also provided a modified version of the original [bMIND](https://github.com/randel/MIND) package for our convenience.
